# PasswordGenerator
This is a simple Password generetor. It will print you a password that contains at least a Uppercase, Lowercase, Number, and special characters.

Right now I have set it with 10 character password. You can change it in the code.


## Examples of a created password :
}5H2.T\42s

y0Fh|NEyw2

At@)5l1G*6


Enjoy using stronger passwords from now :)
